# GAS Target Locking
This project contains a gameplay ability, using UEs Gameplay Ability System Plugin (short GAS), to let a camera "lock" onto a given target.
The ability has settings to influence the way the locking behaves, the speed, the range and if a line of sight check should be made.

Since this is just a showcase I just used a debug key to use it.
For plugin downloads look into the release tab, I will add releases for new versions if I don't forget it.
